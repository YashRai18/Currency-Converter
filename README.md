Currency Converter Using API Calls...

My project, Currency Converter, is a web-based application designed to convert one currency into another in real-time using live exchange rates. 

The application utilizes a reliable third-party API to fetch the latest currency data dynamically. Users can select the source and target currencies from dropdown menus and input the amount they want to convert. Upon clicking the convert button, the app makes an API call to retrieve the current exchange rate and calculates the converted value instantly. 

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates my understanding of API integration, DOM manipulation, and real-world application development.

I have used Base_URL ->  "https://api.currencyapi.com/v3/latest"  &  API_KEY is ->  "cur_live_ZaFCgx8pgPGw0TlP3ZUzo9VdQXLqn009fYyhHwEg"  to fetch real-time data of currency exchange rate.
Also used `https://flagsapi.com/${countryCode}/flat/64.png` to change the image of the flag of different countries using flagsapi.com  dynamically.
